# Development and debugging

## Lexicon construction

<!--N -->

So, you've got your morphotactics more or less sorted out, and you've made a good start on your morphophonological rules. Where are you going to get the lexemes ? Depending on the language you choose you may already have a beautifully prepared list of stems. For other languages there might be a dictionary with less elaborate systems of classes, perhaps traditional ones that underspecify the morphology, or perhaps ones that don't specify the morphology at all. In the worst case you may have to just rely on a Swadesh list or a simple list of inflected forms from a corpus. 

In any case, whether you have a complete system or just a list of inflected forms, the best idea is to work adding words to the lexicon by **frequency** of appearance in whichever corpus you have. You might have easy access to a corpus, if not you can use a [Wikipedia database backup dump](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html) or you can write a webcrawler for some online newspaper. You can use [`WikiExtractor.py`](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/apertium/svn/trunk/apertium-tools/WikiExtractor.py) script to extract raw text from Wiki dump.


1. Download the latest version of Guaraní Wikipedia.
   - Go to [Wikipedia database backup dumps](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html)
   - Find the link for `gnwiki` and click on it.
   - Download the file that ends in `-pages-articles.xml.bz2`.
2. Run `WikiExtractor.py` using the following command:

```bash
$ python3 WikiExtractor.py --infn gnwiki-20191120-pages-articles.xml.bz2
```

You will get a lot of output representing the names of the articles in the Wikipedia. 

**TIP:** If you get an error like `No such file or directory`, try doing `ls *.bz2` to find the name of the file.

Now you have `wiki.txt` file, this contains all the text from Wikipedia.

We can get a frequency list using simple `bash` script:

```bash
$ cat wiki.txt | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > hitparade.txt
```

This takes the text in `wiki.txt`, applies a <u>tr</u>ansforms all spaces into newlines `\n`, then it sorts
the list and counts `-c` <u>uniq</u>ue instances. These are then sorted again by number of instances.

You can look at the first 10 lines of output like this:

```bash
$ head hitparade.txt 
  19665 ha
   6694 
   4350 peteĩ
   4299 de
   3581 umi
   3331 haʼe
   3066 avei
   2926 ary
   2293 pe
   2174 upe
```

We can find out the number of words in the frequency list:
```bash
$ wc -l hitparade.txt 
101089 hitparade.txt
```
Let's compare this output with part of speech and gloss in English. 

| Num   | Grn   | POS   | Eng    |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 19665 | ha    | CCONJ | "and"  |
| 4350  | peteĩ | DET   | "a"    |
| 4299  | de    | PREP  | "of"   |
| 3581  | umi   | PRON  | "this" |
| 3331  | haʼe  | VERB  | "be"   |
| 3066  | avei  | ADV   | "also" |
| 2926  | ary   | NOUN  | "day"  |
| 2293  | pe    | LOC   | "in"   |
| 2174  | upe   | PRON  | "that" |

The picture below shows a graphical representation of Zipf's law. 

![](img/Zipf.png)

As you can see the most frequent words are unsurprising for a text from Wikipedia, words about time and place, closed category words like conjunctions, adpositions and pronouns and copula verbs. This was from a corpus of around 431,826 tokens, so the list won't be so representative for the language as a whole, but the bigger and more balanced the corpus the more legit the frequency list is going to be and the better it is going to represent the language that your analyser is likely to be asked to process.

## More on morphotactics 

When moving from making a morphological model of a few words from a grammar to making one that covers a whole corpus you are bound to come across some examples of things that are either underdescribed or not described at all in the extant grammars. For example, how loan words are treated and how to deal with numerals or abbreviations which take affixes according to how the words are pronounced and not how they are written.

### Loan words 
<!--N -->

Guaraní local nasalisation rules do not work for Spanish loans. Thus, we have *irũme* but *asociaciónpe*, the form of the locative does not change despite following a nasal. How to deal with that? Introduce some archiphoneme that will "cancel" the nasalisation rule.

For example we can introduce a new lexicon `N-SPA` and an archiphoneme `%{s%}`, see code below:

```
LEXICON N-SPA

:%{s%} N ; 

LEXICON Nouns

irũ:irũ N ; ! "amigo"
asociación:asociación N-SPA ;
declaración:declaración N-SPA ;
```

**¡OJO!** Don't forget to add `%{s%}` to the set of `Multichar_Symbol`s.

Now we can add an exception to nasalisation rule we defined earlier in `twol` file. This way the transducer will overlook the cases where the nasalisation is not needed.

You should first add the pair `%{s%}:0` to the alphabet, as `%{s%}` will never surface as anything aside from `0`.

```
"Surface [m] in loc affix after nasals"
%{m%}:m <=> Nas: %>: _ ;
            except
            %{s%}: %>: _ ;
```

Then recompile and try running

```bash
$ hfst-fst2strings grn.gen.hfst | grep loc
apyka<n><loc>:apykape
asociación<n><loc>:asociaciónpe
ava<n><n><loc>:avape
declaración<n><loc>:declaraciónpe
irũ<n><loc>:irũme
tembiasa<n><loc>:tembiasape
óga<n><loc>:ógape
```

### Numerals and abbreviations 
<!-- N -->

Numerals and abbreviations also present a problem: they do not provide us with any information at all about how the word should be pronounced (as they are written in digits or letter symbols). Take a look at this following example: 

| Onohẽ           | iPod | ary  | 2001-me  | ha  | ary  | 2003-pe  | tienda online | vendeha    | puraheikuéra         | ha iTunes  |
|-----------------|------|------|----------|-----|------|----------|---------------|------------|----------------------|------------|
| SG3-release      | iPod | year | 2001-LOC | and | year | 2003-LOC | shop online   | sell-SUBST | song-PL              | and iTunes |
|                 |      |      |          |     |      |          |               |            |                      |            |

- "They released the iPod in 2001 and in 2003 started to sell songs in an online shop and on iTunes".

The ajacent suffix depends on the pronounciation of the final digit in the number, for example, `1` is pronounced as *peteĩ* where the final `ĩ` is nasal and `3` is pronounced as *mbohapy* where `y` is not nasal.

Thus we can have a lexicon of digits with the archiphoneme, for example,  `%{d%}` indicating whether the nasal alternation should be done or not.

Here is an excerpt from a transducer in lexc that handles numeral expressions:

```
LEXICON NUM-DIGIT

%<num%>:%- CASE ;

LEXICON LOOP

LAST-DIGIT ;
DIGITLEX ;


LEXICON LAST-DIGIT

1:1%{d%} NUM-DIGIT ; !"peteĩ"
3:3 NUM-DIGIT ; !"mbohapy"

LEXICON DIGITLEX

%0:%0 LOOP ;
1:1   LOOP ;
2:2   LOOP ;
3:3   LOOP ;
4:4   LOOP ;
5:5   LOOP ;
6:6   LOOP ;
7:7   LOOP ;
8:8   LOOP ;
9:9   LOOP ;
```
It is not complete but it should give you enough pointers to be able to implement it.

You can add the rest of the Guaraní numerals to the lexicon:

- 2 - *mokõi*
- 4 - *irundy*
- 5 - *po*
- 6 - *poteĩ*
- 7 - *pokõi*
- 8 - *poapy*
- 9 - *porundy*

Note that in the `Alphabet` in your `twol` file you can specify these kind of symbols as always going to `0`:

```
Alphabet

A B Ã C D E Ẽ G G̃ H I Ĩ J K L M N Ñ O Õ P R S T U Ũ V W X Y Z Ỹ Á É Í Ó Ú Ý   F Q
a b ã c d e ẽ g g̃ h i ĩ j k l m n ñ o õ p r s t u ũ v w x y z ỹ á é í ó ú ý ʼ f q

%{m%}:p
%{m%}:m
%{s%}:0 
%{d%}:0
```

This saves you writing rules to make them correspond with nothing on the surface.

Try to implement a rule that takes into account this alternation.

When you have finished you should be able to analyse:

```
$ echo "2001<num><loc>" | hfst-lookup -q grn.gen.hfst
2001-me

$ echo "2003<num><loc>" | hfst-lookup -q grn.gen.hfst
2003-pe 
```

<!--### Guessers -->
<!-- FMT -->

<!--## Unit testing -->
<!-- FMT -->

## Evaluation
<!-- FMT -->

As with all tasks, there are various ways to evaluate morphological transducers. Two of the 
most popular are *naïve* coverage and precision and recall.

### Coverage 

The typical way to evaluate coverage as you are developing the transducer is by calculating
the *naïve* coverage. That is we calculate the percentage of tokens in our corpus
that receive at least one analysis from our morphological analyser. We can do this easily 
in `bash`, for example:

```bash
$ total=`cat wiki.txt  | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z]\+/ /g' | tr ' ' '\n'  | grep -v '^$' | wc -l`
$ unknown=`cat wiki.txt  | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z]\+/ /g' | tr ' ' '\n'  | grep -v '^$' | hfst-lookup -qp grn.mor.hfst  | grep 'inf' | wc -l`
$ echo "(($total-$unknown)/$total)*100" | bc -l
.26811417711107473200
```

 So our current Guaraní analyser has a coverage of 0.26%... not very impressive yet!

Note: If your coverage is different from the number you see here, do not worry, so long as it is around the same (to within 5%) it's probably just an effect of having different versions of the same corpus.

Alternatively it would be possible to write a Python script. A good rule of thumb is that given an an average sized corpus (under one million tokens) for averagely inflected language (from English to Finnish) 500 of the most frequent stems should get you around 50% coverage, 1,000 should get you around 70% coverage, and 10,000 should get you around 80% coverage. Getting 90% coverage will mean adding around 20,000 stems. 

You can take the `bash` code from above and put it in a file called `coverage.sh`, this will allow you to calculate the coverage
easily as you continue improving the transducer.

```bash
$ bash coverage.sh 
.26811417711107473200
```

### Precision and recall 


The second way is to calculate precision, recall and F-measure like with other NLP tasks. To calculate
this you need a *gold standard*, that is a collection of words annotated by a linguist and 
native speaker which contain all and only the valid analyses of the word. Given the gold standard, 
we can calculate the precision and recall as follows:
* Precision, *P* = number of analyses which were found in both the output from the morphological analyser and the gold standard, divided by the tot
al number of analyses output by the morphological analyser
* Recall, *R* = number of analyses found in both the output from the morphological analyser and the gold standard, divided by the number of analyse
s found in the morphological analyser plus the number of analyses found in the gold standard but not in the morphological analyser. 

Thus, suppose we had the following:


<!-- MORE -->

There is a script <a href="https://ftyers.github.io/2017-КЛ_МКЛ/scripts/evaluate-morph.py">evaluate-morph</a> that will calculate precision, recall
and F-score for output from an analyser for a set of surface forms.

As these kind of collections are hard to come by &mdash; they require careful hand annotation &mdash; 
some people resort to producing a *pseudo-*gold standard using an annotated corpus. However,
note that this may not contain all of the possible analyses so may misjudge the quality of the analyser 
by penalising or not giving credit to analyses which are possible but not found in the corpus.

In all cases a random sample of surface forms should be used to ensure coverage of cases from across the frequency range.

## Generating paradigms 
<!-- FMT -->

A finite-state transducer can be used in addition to produce either paradigm tables or all the forms 
of a given word.  First we produce a transducer which accepts the stem we are interested in plus
the lexical category and any number of other tags, `?*`:

```
$ echo "i r ũ %<n%> ?*" | hfst-regexp2fst -o irũ.hfst
```

Then we compose intersect the whole morphological generator with this transducer to find only those 
paths which start with that prefix:

```
$ hfst-compose-intersect -2 grn.gen.hfst -1 irũ.hfst | hfst-fst2strings
```

This is less useful than it may appear because it also produces all of the derived 
forms. If we want to just include the inflected forms we can just list the forms we want to 
generate for a given part of speech in a file, for example:

```
$ cat noun-paradigm.txt 
%<n%> %<nom%>
%<n%> %<gen%>
%<n%> %<ins%>
%<n%> %<pl%> %<gen%>
%<n%> %<pl%> %<nom%>
%<n%> %<pl%> %<ins%>
```
Then compile this file into a transducer in the same way:

```
$ cat noun-paradigm.txt | sed "s/^/i r ũ /g"  | hfst-regexp2fst -j > irũ.hfst 
```

Then finally compose and intersect with our transducer:

```
$ hfst-compose-intersect -2 grn.gen.hfst -1 irũ.hfst | hfst-fst2strings 

```
This kind of full-form paradigm is useful for debugging, and also for generating 
training data for fancy machine-learningy type things. It can also help with 
low-resource dependency parsing (systems like <a href="https://github.com/ufal/udpipe">UDpipe</a> allow
the use of external dictionaries at training time).


## Segmenters

<!-- FMT -->

An additional benefit of working with these kind of transducers is that they can be used to make
systems for surface form segmentation. For example given the input `ogakuérape` produce the
output `oga>kuéra>pe`.

These kind of segmenters can be useful in various downstream tasks, such as machine translation and 
other language modelling tasks where reducing the size of the vocabulary (total number of wordforms) 
can be important.

We will need to do two things, the first is set up our phonological rules file to produce 
surface forms with the morpheme boundaries still specified. The second is create a new phonological rules
file to remove the morpheme boundaries from the analyser and generator.

First let's remove the rule that removes the morpheme boundary in the file `grn.twol` and recompile 
by typing `make`.

```bash
$ hfst-fst2strings grn.gen.hfst  | grep loc
akãvai<n><loc>:akãvaí>pe
apyka<n><loc>:apyká>pe
asociación<n><loc>:asociación>pe
ava<n><n><loc>:avá>pe
declaración<n><loc>:declaración>pe
irũ<n><loc>:irũ>me
óga<n><loc>:ógá>pe
tembiasa<n><loc>:tembiasá>pe
```

Now we have a transducer that maps from analyses, e.g. `akãvai<n><loc>` to surface forms with morpheme
boundaries in `akãvaí>pe`.

We now need to make a new `.twol` file, let's call it `grn.mor.twol` that removes morpheme boundaries:

```
Alphabet
  
A B Ã C D E Ẽ G G̃ H I Ĩ J K L M N Ñ O Õ P R S T U Ũ V W X Y Z Ỹ Á É Í Ó Ú Ý   F Q
a b ã c d e ẽ g g̃ h i ĩ j k l m n ñ o õ p r s t u ũ v w x y z ỹ á é í ó ú ý ʼ f q

%> ;

Rules

"Remove morpheme boundary"
%>:0 <=> _ ;
```

Compile the file using,

```bash
$ hfst-twolc grn.mor.twol -o grn.mor.twol.hfst
Reading input from grn.mor.twol.
Writing output to grn.mor.twol.hfst.
Reading alphabet.
Reading rules and compiling their contexts and centers.
Compiling rules.
Storing rules.
```

And then apply it to the generator, `grn.gen.hfst` using the following command:

```bash
$ hfst-compose-intersect -1 grn.gen.hfst -2 grn.mor.twol.hfst -o grn.mor.hfst
```

Check that the file contains the right strings:
```bash
$ hfst-fst2strings grn.mor.hfst  | grep loc
akãvai<n><loc>:akãvaípe
apyka<n><loc>:apykápe
asociación<n><loc>:asociaciónpe
ava<n><n><loc>:avápe
declaración<n><loc>:declaraciónpe
irũ<n><loc>:irũme
tembiasa<n><loc>:tembiasápe
óga<n><loc>:ogápe
```

Looks good!

So now we have two transducers:

| `grn.gen.hfst`   |   | `grn.mor.hfst`  |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| Left   | Right  | Left  | Right  |
|---|---|---|---|
| `akãvai<n><loc>`   | `akãvaí>pe`  | `akãvai<n><loc>`     | `akãvaípe`   |

In order to make a segmenter, we should invert the transducer `grn.mor.hfst` to get the analysis on the right side and 
then compose it with the `grn.gen.hfst` transducer. Try the following command:

```bash
$ hfst-invert grn.mor.hfst | hfst-compose -1 - -2 grn.gen.hfst -o grn.seg.hfst
```

And then you can try using it:

```bash
$ echo "akãvaípe" | hfst-lookup -qp grn.seg.hfst 
akãvaípe	akãvaí>pe	0,000000
```
